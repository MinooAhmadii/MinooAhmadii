## 🔬 What I'm Working On

- **AutoML for Medical AI** - Automated hyperparameter optimization that imitates expert intuition for ophthalmology diagnostics
- **RAG-Enhanced LLM Systems** - Context-enriched pipelines combining GPT-4 with SciBERT embeddings for biomedical term standardization
- **Multi-Modal Learning** - Computer vision frameworks with limited expert annotations and preference-based optimization
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** - Building LLM-RAG chatbots for scientific data repositories like FaceBase with vector embeddings
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback** - Developing RLHF systems for medical diagnostic applications
